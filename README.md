Atlassian Connect Framework to build add-ons for the JIRA and Confluence

## Requirements

* Laravel 5.5
* PHP ~7.0

## Getting Started

### Installing

Install dependency via Composer

``` bash
$ composer require brezzhnev/atlassian-connect-core
```

Register **route middleware** `jwt` by adding to `app\Http\Kernel.php` the following line:

``` php
'jwt' => \AtlassianConnectCore\Http\Middleware\JWTAuth::class
```

Set authentication driver to `jwt` in `config/auth.php`:

``` php
'guards' => [
    'web' => [
        'driver' => 'jwt',
        'provider' => 'users',
    ],
...
```

Set model class in `config/auth.php` **providers** section:

``` php
'providers' => [
    'users' => [
        'driver' => 'eloquent',
        'model' => \AtlassianConnectCore\Models\Tenant::class,
    ],
...
```

Register the subscriber in the `app/Providers/EventServiceProvider.php`:

``` php
/**
 * The subscriber classes to register.
 *
 * @var array
 */
protected $subscribe = [
    \AtlassianConnectCore\Listeners\PluginEventSubscriber::class
];
```

Configure database and run the following:

```
php artisan migrate
php artisan plugin:install
```

The command `php artisan plugin:install` will publish config, views and resources that you can change for your needs.

Also, it will create "dummy" tenant needed for local testing and development 
without the need of installing the add-on in real JIRA or Confluence instance.

### Get it working

If your application returns the add-on descriptor on the request 
to URL `http://localhost:8000/atlassian-connect.json` it means you are close to happiness and you can
install the add-on.

Firstly, you need to enable the development options. 
Go to the "Manage add-ons" page. You'll see the link "Settings" at bottom of the page. 
After clicking you'll see two checkboxes that must be selected. Apply your changes.

For installing the add-on in the instance, the last one should see your server.
If you are working locally the easiest way is to use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/).

After you are visible in the worldwide you should put your actual website URL to environment variable `PLUGIN_URL`.
Also, you need to configure your add-on by editing the file `config/plugin.php`. 
Most values may be overwritten using env vars. 

Then you need to upload the add-on. Click "Upload add-on" and paste your public URL with descriptor path, 
eg. `https://d1ea31ce.ngrok.io/atlassian-connect.json` or `https://yourplugindomain.com/atlassian-connect.json`

> Note: HTTPS is required

After successfully installing you can see "Your add-on" top menu item (in case of JIRA). 
You also can go to the add-on general page by direct link `:product_base_url/plugins/servlet/ac/sample-plugin/hello-page`

> Instead `:product_base_url` you should put your JIRA or Cofluence instance URL (eg. `https://google-dev.atlassian.net`).

If you see page working, the application configured and add-on installed correctly.

### Publish resources

Instead of using `plugin:install` you can perform actions manually.

To copy all the publishes you should use the following command:

```
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="AtlassianConnectCore\ServiceProvider"
```

To copy only specific publish you must call this command with option `--tag`. 
The value can be `public` (to copy assets), `views` and `config`.

## Workflow

### Add-On Configuration

After copying publishes you can see the file `config/plugin.php` in your application. 
Please, use this configuration file to change add-on properties.

### Default routes

The following routes are registered by default:

* `GET /atlassian-connect.json` descriptor contents
* `POST /installed` add-on installed callback
* `POST /uninstalled` add-on uninstalled callback
* `POST /enabled` add-on enabled callback
* `POST /disabled` add-on disabled callback
* `GET /hello` sample page to persuade all working correctly

You can disable them by setting to `false` config value `plugin.loadRoutes`.

### Descriptor

You can use `Descriptor` facade to customize or create from scratch your own descriptor contents.

For example, you can customize it by adding to the `app\Providers\AppServiceProvider` in `boot` section the following:

``` php
Descriptor::base() // base descriptor contents
    ->setScopes(['admin' , 'act_as_user'])
    ->withModules([
        'webhooks' => [[
            'event' => 'jira:issue_created',
            'url' => route('webhookHandlerRouteName')
        ]]
    ])
    ->set('version', $this->getLatestPluginVersion());
```

> Warning: if you are using `route` helper in the `AppServiceProvider` you should have `RouteServiceProvider` defined above `AppServiceProvider` in your `app.php` config.

### Performing requests

In most cases of add-on development for Atlassian Product you need to perform requests to the instance. 

For this case you can use `JWTClient`. It uses [GuzzleHttp](https://github.com/guzzle/guzzle) as HTTP client. 

> If you want to have custom handling (middlewares etc.) you can pass client instance to the constructor.

#### Pagination

If you want to send a request to an endpoint with pagination you should use `JWTClient::paginate` method. In most cases
you don't need to pass paginator instance to the `JWTClient` constructor because it will instantiate automatically by resolving 
your Tenant product type (JIRA or Confluence), but you always can use specific paginator.

There are two paginators:
* `JiraPaginator`
* `ConfluencePaginator`

Of course you can extend `Paginator` class and create your own.

#### Examples

**Get a Confluence page content**

``` php
use AtlassianConnectCore\Http\Clients\JWTClient;

...


public function pageContent(int $id): array
{
    $client = new JWTClient($this->tenant); // or Auth::user() if you performing a request from the instance
    
    return $client->get('rest/api/content/ . $id', [
        'query' => [
            'expand' => 'body.storage'
        ]
    ]);
}
```

**Get a JIRA issue**

``` php
use AtlassianConnectCore\Http\Clients\JWTClient;

...


public function viewIssue(string $key): array
{
    $client = new JWTClient($this->tenant);
    
    return $client->get('rest/api/2/issue/ . $key');
}
```

### Webhooks

The plugin provides a way to handle incoming webhooks, it uses Laravel Events so you can use habitual way to use them.

> If you don't familiar with Laravel Events, please take a look at [Laravel Docs](https://laravel.com/docs/5.5/events)

There are two ways to define webhook listeners:

1\. Define listeners in the `config/plugin.php`

``` php
'webhooks' => [
    'jira:issue_updated' => \App\Listeners\Webhooks\Issue\Created::class,
    ...
]
```

2\. Define listeners using the `Webhook` facade, for example:

``` php
Webhook::listen('jira:issue_created', function(\Illuminate\Http\Request $request) {
    // ...
});
```

As you can see, you can define event listener as a closure or as a string in Laravel-like syntax:

``` php
Webhook::listen('jira:issue_created', \App\Listeners\Webhooks\Issue\Created::class);
Webhook::listen('jira:issue_created', 'App\Listeners\Webhooks\Issue\Created@handle');
```

#### Example listener

``` php
<?php

namespace App\Listeners\Webhooks\Issue;

use Illuminate\Http\Request;
use AtlassianConnectCore\Models\Tenant;

class Created
{
    /**
     * Create the event listener.
     *
     * @return void
     */
    public function __construct()
    {
        //
    }

    /**
     * Handle incoming webhook
     *
     * @param \Illuminate\Http\Request $request
     * @param \AtlassianConnectCore\Models\Tenant $tenant
     *
     * @return void
     */
    public function handle(Request $request, Tenant $tenant)
    {
        // Access the order using $event->order...
    }
}
```

> Your event listeners may also type-hint any dependencies they need on their constructors. 
All event listeners are resolved via the Laravel service container, so dependencies will be injected automatically.

The handling method have the following parameters:

1. `$request` - Request instance with Webhooks payload.
1. `$tenant` - Authenticated Tenant model instance.

### Console commands

* `plugin:install` is a helper command that creates "dummy" tenant with fake data and publishes package resources (config, views, assets)
* `plugin:dummy` provides interactive way to set tenant as "dummy" without manually editing database

## Tests

Run the following in the package folder:

```
vendor/bin/phpunit
```

## TODO

* Implement descriptor builder and validator
* Implement webhooks manager
* Take out pagination and make more abstract

## Security
